  <h1>I love soccer</h1> <br>
  <h2>I play for <strong>Calvin University</strong></h2>

  <p>I am from Charlotte, North Carolina, and I have been playing soccer for 16 years</p> <br>
  <p>Here are some reasons why I like the game</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It keeps you fit and strong</li>
    <li>It makes you think and keep your brain active</li>
    <li>It teaches you life lessons such as team chemistry and selflessness</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Here is a picture of my favorite soccer player, Thiago Alcantara</p>
